    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",

    "This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for calling extra attention to featured content or information.": "",
    "Page header": "",
    "A simple shell for an <code>h1</code> to appropratiely space out and segment sections of content on a page. It can utilize the <code>h1</code>'s default <code>small</code>, element as well most other components (with additional styles).": "",

    "Default thumbnails": "",
    "By default, Bootstrap's thumbnails are designed to showcase linked images with minimal required markup.": "",
    "Highly customizable": "",
    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",
    "Goes great with javascript": "",
    "Bootstrap comes with a great jQuery plugin that supports alert messages, making dismissing them quick and easy.": "",
    "Get the plugin &raquo;</a>": "",
    "Example alerts": "",
    "Wrap your message and an optional close icon in a div with simple class.": "",
    "Warning!": "",

    "Behavior": "",
    "Progress bars use CSS3 transitions, so if you dynamically adjust the width via javascript, it will smoothly resize.": "",
    "If you use the <code>.active</code> class, your <code>.progress-striped</code> progress bars will animate the stripes left to right.": "",
    "Browser support": "",

    "Pager": "",

    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",

    "Data": "",
    "Markup": "",
    "HTML is your standard unordered list with links.": "",
    "Two options for paging through content": "",
    "Multicon-page pagination": "",
    "Ultra simplistic and minimally styled pagination inspired by Rdio, great for apps and search results. The large block is hard to miss, easily scalable, and provides large click areas.": "",
    "Stateful page links": "",
    "Links are customizable and work in a number of circumstances with the right class. <code>.disabled</code> for unclickable links and <code>.active</code> for current page.": "",
    "Flexible alignment": "",
    "Add either of two optional classes to change the alignment of pagination links: <code>.pagination-centered</code> and <code>.pagination-right</code>.": "",
    "The default pagination component is flexible and works in a number of variations.": "",
    "Wrapped in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, pagination is just a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Pager": "",
    "For quick previous and next links": "",
    "About pager": "",
    "The pager component is a set of links for simple pagination implementations with light markup and even lighter styles. It's great for simple sites like blogs or magazines.": "",
    "Optional disabled state": "",
    "Pager links also use the general <code>.disabled</code> class from the pagination.": "",
    "By default, the pager centers links.": "",
    "Previous": "",

    "Typographic components": "",
    "Page header and hero unit for segmenting content": "",
    "Hero unit": "",
    "Bootstrap provides a lightweight, flexible component called a hero unit to showcase content on your site. It works well on marketing and content-heavy sites.": "",
    "Wrap your content in a <code>div</code> like so:": "",
    "Heading": "",
    "Tagline": "",
    "Learn more": "",
    "Hello, world!": "",
    "This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for calling extra attention to featured content or information.": "",
    "Page header": "",
    "A simple shell for an <code>h1</code> to appropratiely space out and segment sections of content on a page. It can utilize the <code>h1</code>'s default <code>small</code>, element as well most other components (with additional styles).": "",
    "Example page header": "",
    "Subtext for header": "",
    "Grids of images, videos, text, and more": "",
    "Default thumbnails": "",
    "By default, Bootstrap's thumbnails are designed to showcase linked images with minimal required markup.": "",
    "Highly customizable": "",
    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",
    "Goes great with javascript": "",
    "Bootstrap comes with a great jQuery plugin that supports alert messages, making dismissing them quick and easy.": "",
    "Get the plugin &raquo;</a>": "",
    "Example alerts": "",
    "Wrap your message and an optional close icon in a div with simple class.": "",
    "Warning!": "",
    "Best check yo self, you're not looking too good.": "",
    "Easily extend the standard alert message with two optional classes: <code>.alert-block</code> for more padding and text controls and <code>.alert-heading</code> for a matching heading.": "",

    "Progress bars use CSS3 transitions, so if you dynamically adjust the width via javascript, it will smoothly resize.": "",
    "If you use the <code>.active</code> class, your <code>.progress-striped</code> progress bars will animate the stripes left to right.": "",
    "Browser support": "",

    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",

    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",

    "With a bit of extra markup, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails.": "",
    "Thumbnail label": "",
    "Why use thumbnails": "",
    "Thumbnails (previously <code>.media-grid</code> up until v1.4) are great for grids of photos or videos, image search results, retail products, portfolios, and much more. They can be links or static content.": "",
    "Simple, flexible markup": "",
    "Thumbnail markup is simple&mdash;a <code>ul</code> with any number of <code>li</code> elements is all that is required. It's also super flexible, allowing for any type of content with just a bit more markup to wrap your contents.": "",
    "Uses grid column sizes": "",
    "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "",
    "The markup": "",
    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
    "For custom HTML content in thumbnails, the markup changes slightly. To allow block level content anywhere, we swap the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> like so:": "",
    "Thumbnail caption right here...": "",
    "More examples": "",
    "Explore all your options with the various grid classes available to you. You can also mix and match different sizes.": "",
    "Styles for success, warning, and error messages": "",
    "Rewritten base class": "",
    "With Bootstrap 2, we've simplified the base class: <code>.alert</code> instead of <code>.alert-message</code>. We've also reduced the minimum required markup&mdash;no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is required by default, just the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.": "",
    "Single alert message": "",
    "For a more durable component with less code, we've removed the differentiating look for block alerts, messages that come with more padding and typically more text. The class also has changed to <code>.alert-block</code>.": "",

    "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "",
